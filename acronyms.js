  },
  {
    "w": "HIPS",
    "e": "Host-based Intrusion Prevention System",
    "d": "Security software that actively prevents malicious activities on individual hosts by blocking suspicious processes, file modifications, and system calls. Provides real-time protection by enforcing security policies at the host level and preventing exploits from succeeding. More proactive than detection systems, providing defense against zero-day attacks through behavioral analysis."
  },
  {
    "w": "FIM",
    "e": "File Integrity Monitoring",
    "d": "A security process that validates the integrity of operating system and application files by detecting unauthorized modifications.

  {
    "w": "SNMP",
    "e": "Simple Network Management Protocol",
    "d": "A protocol for collecting information from and configuring network devices including routers, switches, servers, and security appliances. Security concerns include the use of community strings in older versions and potential for information disclosure. Version 3 added encryption and authentication capabilities to address security vulnerabilities in earlier versions."
  },
  {
    "w": "SMTP",
    "e": "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol",
    "d": "The standard protocol for sending email messages between mail servers across the internet. Originally designed without security features, making it vulnerable to spoofing, interception, and relay abuse. Modern implementations should use TLS encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect email transmission."
  },
  {
    "w": "IMAP",
    "e": "Internet Message Access Protocol",
    "d": "A protocol that allows email clients to access and manage messages stored on mail servers. Provides more sophisticated mailbox management capabilities than POP3, including server-side folders and message flags. Should be secured with TLS encryption to protect credentials and message content during transmission."
  },
  {
    "w": "POP3",
    "e": "Post Office Protocol version 3",
    "d": "A simple protocol for retrieving email from mail servers, typically downloading messages to local clients and deleting them from servers. Less feature-rich than IMAP but widely supported and simple to implement. Should be used with TLS encryption to protect user credentials and email content during retrieval."
  },
  {
    "w": "SMB",
    "e": "Server Message Block",
    "d": "A network file sharing protocol used primarily in Windows environments for accessing files, printers, and other network resources.

Modern implementations should disable SMBv1 and use SMB signing and encryption for security."
  },
  {
    "w": "NFS",
    "e": "Network File System",
    "d": "A distributed file system protocol that allows clients to access files over a network as if they were local. Commonly used in Unix and Linux environments but has security limitations including weak authentication in older versions. Modern implementations should use Kerberos authentication and consider encryption for sensitive data transfers."
  },
