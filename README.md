Look, we all know cybersecurity has way too many dang acronyms. Half the time it feels like we're drowning in acronym soup. CNAPP, CSPM, XDR, SOC, MITRE... and that's just the first 2 minutes of this meeting. So let's try and have some fun while we learn!

Cyberdle is a Wordle-style word game designed for cybersecurity professionals, students, and acronym enthusiasts. Test your knowledge of cybersecurity acronyms by guessing the correct term based on its definition. Each guess provides color-coded feedback: green for letters in the correct position, yellow for letters present elsewhere, and gray for absent letters.

The entire game ships as static files (HTML, CSS, and a single dataset script), so you can double-click `index.html` and start playing immediately. No build step, server, or tooling required. Just pure, online/offline fun!

## Play Online

Come hang out at **[https://cyberdle.adilio.ca/](https://cyberdle.adilio.ca/)** â€” the live site is always up to date and ready for your next streak. Open it on desktop, mobile, or that ancient Chromebook collecting dust in the corner. It just works.

Want to stream it on Twitch? Throw it on the big screen in your SOC? Turn it into your teamâ€™s daily stand-up ritual? Go for it. Itâ€™s free and runs entirely in the browser.

## Quick Start

1. Read the definition and soak in the clues.
2. Guess the acronym (letters and numbers totally welcome).
3. Watch the tiles glow: ðŸŸ© correct spot, ðŸŸ¨ in the word but shuffled, â¬› shaded for not in the acronym.
4. Solve in six tries or less, then flex your results with the builtâ€‘in share card.

You can play in **Daily mode** (same puzzle for everyone worldwide) or **Random mode** (hit refresh for endless chaos). Stats, streaks, and theme preference stick around thanks to localStorageâ€”no accounts or trackers necessary.
