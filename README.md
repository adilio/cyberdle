# Cyberdle

Look, we all know cybersecurity has way too many dang acronyms. Half the time it feels like weâ€™re drowning in acronym soup. CNAPP, CSPM, XDR, SOC, MITRE... and that's jsut the first 2 minutes of this meeting. So lets try and have some fun with this!

Cyberdle is a Wordle-style word game designed for cybersecurity professionals, students, and acronym enthusiasts. Test your knowledge of cybersecurity acronyms by guessing the correct term based on its definition. Each guess provides color-coded feedback: green for letters in the correct position, yellow for letters present elsewhere, and gray for absent letters.

The entire game ships as static files (HTML, CSS, and a single dataset script), so you can double-click `index.html` and start playing immediately. No build step, server, or tooling required. Just pure, online/offline fun!

## How to Play

1. **Read the Definition**: Each puzzle presents a detailed definition of a cybersecurity acronym.
2. **Make Your Guess**: Type your guess using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard.
3. **Get Feedback**: Letters turn green (correct position), yellow (present elsewhere), or gray (absent).
4. **Solve in 6 Tries**: Use the feedback to refine your guesses and solve the acronym.

Choose between **Daily Mode** (same puzzle for everyone each day) or **Random Mode** (fresh puzzle each time).

## Game Features

- **Keyboard-First Design**: Optimized for both physical and on-screen keyboards
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Switch themes to match your preference
- **Local Persistence**: Your stats and progress are saved in browser localStorage
- **Confetti Celebrations**: Win animations that work offline
- **Accessibility-Friendly**: Screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **No External Dependencies**: Runs entirely from static files

## Technical Architecture

- `index.html` - Complete game UI, logic, and inline JavaScript
- `style.css` - Responsive styling with theme support and animations
- `acronyms.js` - Curated dataset of 50+ cybersecurity acronyms via `window.CYBERDLE_DATA`
- **Runtime**: Vanilla browser APIs only; works offline under `file://`
- **Storage**: Uses `cyberdle:simple:*` localStorage keys for persistence

## Run Locally

### Option 1

Double-click `index.html` in your file browser. The game will open directly in your default browser.

### Option 2

Serve over HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
# Visit http://localhost:8000
